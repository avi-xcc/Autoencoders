# Autoencoders
 
This repository creates a simple convolutional autoencoder.

It is built with PyTorch. I have also included sample weights for the neural network.

To run the model:

1. Install the necessary dependent packages, such as PyTorch, Matplotlib, Plotly.
2. To train the model:
```commandline
python trainer.py
```
3. To test the model:
```commandline
python ae_test.py
```
4. To visualize the embedding space:
```commandline
python plot_intermediate.py
```
